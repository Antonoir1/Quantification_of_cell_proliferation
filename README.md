# Quantification of cell proliferation (WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Description:

The goal of this project was to make a tool for the researchers (in the cancer cell proliferation) to use. This tool will count the cell population in a given image (.tif or .tiff), and will even track the cell flows over time, if these images are given with a time order and a prefix (ex: Time => Time00, Time01, Time02...). Warning: the time order must be superior or equal to 0.
